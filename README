Use pipil to create, open, modify, and save images in many common formats (jpg, png, bmp) from your Python code.

The pipil module replaces the need for the Python Imaging Library (PIL), and uses the same functions you know and love.
PIL will be used by default, if it is available, but it is not required. In the event that PIL is unable to be used, pipil will revert to using a bundled Java utility for image processing.

The following functionalities of PIL have been implemented in pipil:
class Image:
    new, open, save, show, getpixel, putpixel
